## Installation

1. Be sure to have SketchUp 2017 or newer.
2. Download latest Universal Importer plugin from the [SketchUcation PluginStore](https://sketchucation.com/plugin/2275-universal_importer).
3. Install plugin following this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyM5f81eRno).

Now, you should have in SketchUp an "Universal Importer" submenu in "Extensions" menu and an "Universal Importer" toolbar.

## Troubleshooting

### I get an error when I import a model on Windows.

(Re)install [Microsoft Visual C++ library](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) then restart Windows.

### Model was imported but textures are missing.

Enable "Claim Missing Textures" option in "Extensions > Universal Importer" menu then import model again.

### On SketchUp 2017, imported model has bad texture coordinates and/or face count after polygon reduction is unexpected.

Do "File > Import", select "COLLADA files (*.dae)", click "Options", uncheck "Merge coplanar faces", click "OK", close dialog then re-import model with the plugin.

### When I reduce the polygon count of a mesh exported from CloudCompare, the plugin only imports one line.

Go back to CloudCompare, deselect "Preserve global shift on save", export again the mesh, then import it again with Universal Importer.

### My problem isn't resolved or isn't listed above.
